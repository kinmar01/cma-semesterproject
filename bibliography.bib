	abstract = {Scatter-hoarding birds provide effective long-distance seed dispersal for plants. Transporting seeds far promotes population spread, colonization of new areas, and connectivity between populations. However, whether seeds transported over long distances are deposited in habitats favorable to plant regeneration has rarely been investigated, mainly due to methodological constraints. To investigate dispersal patterns and distances of Swiss stone pine (Pinus cembra) seeds we utilized advances in tracking technology to track the movements of their sole disperser, the spotted nutcracker (Nucifraga caryocatactes). We found routine individual movements between single seed harvesting and seed caching site. Harvesting sites of individual birds overlapped, whereas seed caching sites were separated and located on average 5.3 km away from the harvesting site. Interestingly, most distant caching sites were located at low elevations and in spruce forest, where Swiss stone pine does not naturally occur. This suggests that nutcrackers disperse seeds over long distances but that a large portion of these seeds are cached outside the known pine habitat. Therefore, we conclude that the implications of such long-distance seed dispersal movements for plant populations should be carefully considered in combination with the effects of habitat quality on plant recruitment.},

	abstract = {Seed dispersal is a key component in a plant's life cycle, allowing the colonization of new habitat and eventually enabling range shifts. For animal-dispersed plants, the behaviour of seed-dispersing animals has direct consequences for the fate of a seed. However, there is little empirical evidence on how individual behaviour of animals affects seed dispersal. Here we investigated the effects of individual behaviour on seed dispersal distance and location by analysing movement data of spotted nutcrackers (Nucifraga caryocatactes) during harvest and scatter-hoarding of Swiss stone pine (Pinus cembra) seeds. To assess individual variation in seed dispersal patterns, we compared daytime hourly displacement patterns across individuals. We further identified seed caching locations of individual birds and analysed their potential for pine regeneration. We found that nutcrackers showed one of two distinct behaviours: short-distance seed dispersal and long-distance seed dispersal. The caching locations resulting from the two behaviours differed markedly in the regeneration potential of Swiss stone pine: seeds transported over short distances were cached at high elevations with high regeneration potential within the pine's current habitat, while seeds transported over long distances were cached at low elevations with low regeneration potential outside of the pine's habitat. The behaviours were not associated with bird body mass, relative wing length or sex. Our results emphasize that intraspecific individual behaviours of seed-dispersing animals can have far-reaching consequences for ecosystem functions. As a major determinant of seed dispersal dynamics, individual behaviour should be taken into account for a better understanding of ecosystem functions under current and future environmental conditions.

abstract = {Abstract Data representing the trajectories of moving point objects are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in GIScience, and are the focus of much methodological research aimed at extracting patterns and meaning describing the underlying phenomena. However, current research within GIScience in this area has largely ignored issues related to scale and granularity – in other words how much are the patterns that we see a function of the size of the looking glass that we apply? In this article we investigate the implications of varying the temporal scale at which three movement parameters, speed, sinuosity and turning angle are derived, and explore the relationship between this temporal scale and uncertainty in the individual data points making up a trajectory. A very rich dataset, representing the movement of 10 cows over some two days every 0.25 s is investigated. Our cross-scale analysis shows firstly, that movement parameters for all 10 cows are broadly similar over a range of scales when the data are segmented to remove quasi-static subtrajectories. However, by exploring realistic values of GPS uncertainty using Monte Carlo Simulation, it becomes apparent that fine scale measurement of all movement parameters is masked by uncertainties, and that we can only make meaningful statements about movement when we take these uncertainties into account.},

title = {Discovering Similar Multidimensional Trajectories},
year = {2002},
publisher = {IEEE Computer Society},
address = {USA},
abstract = {We investigate techniques for analysis and retrieval of object trajectories in a two or three dimensional space. Examples include features extracted from video clips, animal mobility experiments, sign language recognition, mobile phone usage and so on. Such data usually contain a great amount of noise, that degrades the performance of previously used metrics. Therefore, here we formalize non-metric similarity functions based on the Longest Common Subsequence (LCSS), which are very robust to noise and furthermore provide an intuitive notion of similarity between trajectories by giving more weight to the similar portions of the sequences. Stretching of sequences in time is allowed, as well as global translating of the sequences in space. Efficient approximate algorithms that compute these similarity measures are also provided. We compare these new methods to the widely used Euclidean and Time Warping distance functions (for real and synthetic data) and show the superiority of our approach, especially under the strong presence of noise. We prove a weaker version of the triangle inequality and employ it in an indexing structure to answer nearest neighbor queries. Finally, we present experimental results that validate the accuracy and efficiency of our approach.},
